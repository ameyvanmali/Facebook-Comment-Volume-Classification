# Facebook-Comment-Volume-Classification
This data set contains information related to user comments on the Facebook and the effort has been made to design a model using Supervised learning algorithms to classify a given post that would receive a comment within or more than an hour. I have used Support Vector Machines (Linear, Polynomial with various degree, and Sigmoid kernels), Decision Trees (Entropy), and Boosting (AdaBoost) to train the model and get optimum results.
